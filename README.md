### In this project I am testing to trigger the github action where we will run the go code, build the binary of that and then upload it in aws s3.

![Go_GithubActions_AWS_S3 drawio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26185774/214230898-82da9ec1-6cc2-46c0-a1bb-75c50c3b4c2f.png)




test_develop_push workflow will trigger when ever we will push a commit to develop branch.



A new tag will be created whenever we will merge something from develop to main branch
